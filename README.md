Artemis Financial wants to add a file verification step to its web application to ensure secure communications. When the web application is used to transfer data, the company will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum. A strong hash function I recommend is SHA-256. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash that creates a unique 256-bit string from any input of data.( Ballejos, 2024) Jeff Lowery mentioned in his 2020 article “MD5 vs SHA-1 vs SHA-2 - Which is the Most Secure Encryption Hash and How to Check Them”, That the ideal hash function returns no collisions. A collision being two different inputs of data creating the same hash value. Having two different inputs that create the same hash value can lead to secure data getting into the wrong hands. This is like the open sesame analogy in Iron Clad Java, where you create a message to open a door and someone records your message and they use it to open your door. While MD5 may be faster, SHA-256 is more secure and was created by National Institute of Standards and Technology and they recommend use SHA-256 over MD5 or SHA-1.(Lowery, 2020) It is a part of the SHA-2 family and as of today it is the most widely used and considered the most robust. SHA-256 does not utilize random numbers or symmetric and non-symmetric keys, but the key generation is random. SHA-256 can be paired with tools that of random numbers or symmetric and non-symmetric keys.
